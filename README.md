# Serverless Community Survey

The serverless landscape is constantly evolving, and trying to keep up with the latest innovations and trends is a daunting task. As someone who loves building things with serverless (and sharing that knowledge with others), I wanted to get a better understanding of the serverless community. I find it incredibly helpful to understand how others use serverless, what they are building with it, and the challeges they are facing.

### So what's the deal with this survey?

There have been several great serverless surveys, but I wanted to create one **for** the community, **by** the community. What questions do **YOU** want answered? How can the answers to these questions help you further the goal of serverless adoption, either in your organization, or for customers of your product? 

### The Results!
The raw data (minus any personally identifiable information) is now available for **ANYONE** in the community to use as they please. Use it to help choose the most popular framework or database for your organization. Discover new use cases that you can shift workloads to. If you're building serverless tools and products, use it to understand which services potential customers are using, what their pain points are, and where they are in their serverless journeys.
