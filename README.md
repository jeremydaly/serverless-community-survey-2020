# Serverless Community Survey

The serverless landscape is constantly evolving, and trying to keep up with the latest innovations and trends is a daunting task. As someone who loves building things with serverless (and sharing that knowledge with others), I wanted to get a better understanding of the serverless community. I find it incredibly helpful to understand how others use serverless, what they are building with it, and the challeges they are facing.

### So what's the deal with this survey?

There have been several great serverless surveys, but I wanted to create one **for** the community, **by** the community. What questions do **YOU** want answered? How can the answers to these questions help you further the goal of serverless adoption, either in your organization, or for customers of your product? 

### Are you open-sourcing the survey results?
**YES!!!** The raw data will be published (minus any personally identifiable information) for **ANYONE** in the community to use as they please. Use it to help choose the most popular framework or database for your organization. Discover new use cases that you can shift workloads to. If you're building serverless tools and products, use it to understand which services potential customers are using, what their pain points are, and where they are in their serverless journeys.

### How many respondents do you expect?
Hopefully, a lot! In order to run a high quality survey and offer participants a chance to win something, I've partnered with the team at [Nuweba](https://www.nuweba.com/) to sponsor the survey. They are going to cover survey expenses, host the realtime results, and donate an **Oculus Quest** and a **Nintendo Switch** as prizes for participants. They will have access to the same data as everyone else. An email address will be required in order to enter the drawing, but it **WILL NOT** be used for marketing purposes.

I will also feature the survey in the [Off-by-none](https://offbynone.io) newsletter and on the [Serverless Chats Podcast](https://www.serverlesschats.com).

### How can I participate?
Below there are some sample/possible questions. Please feel free to suggest new questions, add or change answers to existing ones, or tell me that some of these questions don't make any sense! You can add an [ISSUE](https://github.com/jeremydaly/serverless-community-survey-2020/issues), send an email to contact[at]jeremydaly.com, or DM me on Twitter ([@jeremy_daly](https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly)).

### When will this survey go live?
I'm shooting for a go live date of **Feburary 4th, 2020**, and the survey will run for **four weeks**.

## Possible Questions
Below are a list of possible questions to ask respondents. This is where I **NEED YOUR HELP!** These are just some ideas that I had with some possible answer, but there are many more questions that could be asked. Your feedback is critical to making this survey a success.

As I get feedback, I'll update the questions and answers. Please do not submit PRs, it'll be too hard to manage.

Also, the questions below are in no particular order, so the final survey will flow better than this list.
